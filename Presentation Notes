Problem
	groups too large
	groups have personality types that don't compliment each other
	Two leader types will butt heads
	A group of 4 creatives will never actually finish the
	Bond with team leads to
		Less likely to leave company
		More engaged in work
		Less likely to be overly stressed because have team support

Our solution
	Rationale behind ours
		dating sites use compatibility
		Wikipedia fireteam quote 1
		Wikipedia fireteam quote 2
	Projects are moved around and divided, squads stay together
	Squads get technical resource as needed, technical resource is not added to squad
		Creative, disruptive, evolutionary ideas come from newcomers to a field
	The benefits of the cohesion of the small team and compatibility of their personality types will create engagement and flow that is more benficial than grouping by specialization would be
		Attitude not aptitude.  Nothing beats hard work.  
	People do need baseline technical ability, responsibility, and likability
	How you get along with your coworkers is a huge part of job satisfaction
	


How it works
	Show our site
	Employer sends out assessment invite to employees
	Employer sends us identifier for their employees
	Employees take assessment
	We use API to get results
	We create groups
	We send groups to employer
	Our grouping algorithm
		3 categories
			specialists
			generalists
			multi-skill
		assign by shortage

	Additional applications
		hiring
			Hire squads all at once and onboard together
			Have applicants take Traitify test
			Have personality type be something that can be displayed on LinkedIn and job application sites like AngelList and searched for by hiring employers
		school class project groups
		hackathon groups
			Try grouping like this for half the people and at the end see which half performed better and was more satisfied with team dynamic
		Use machine learning, such as that offered by Haven, to refine ideal team size and personality composition, and the weight this has compared to other qualities in a worked
