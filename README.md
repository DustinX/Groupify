# Hackathon

Project Ideas:

1. 
How to organize teams in fireteams by ideal composition using traitify.
Groups of 4.  Uses military psychology for what makes effective teams.
Fireteam more effective than larger team, or no teams at all.  Be close knit.
Leader, creative, work ethic, social.
Every member would need to have technical ability and base level of teamwork traits like likable, good worker, etc.

To start, we would take all their existing teams and organize it into the fireteams.
They would also use it for hiring, to make new fire teams.
Don't split up fireteams.  Instead, break up projects and move projects around.
Better to just give a team an advisor or tech resource instead of breaking up team.  The most important thing is work ethic and organization, so technical knowledge of subject is less important than focus of group and team cohesion.

Improves employee retention.
Improves committment and energy for project.
