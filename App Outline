Flesh out idea

	Philosophy:
		Teams work best if grouped into fireteams, similar to how the military performs.  Teammembers will work harder and collaborate better in these groups than they would as part of a larger, general group.  Teammembers will work harder to not let each other down.  They will feel more comfortable asking for help from each other.

		Teams are not moved around or grouped around projects.  The fireteam is the core.  Projects are assigned to fireteams, and large projects can be assigned to (and probably broken up for) multiple fireteams.  Fireteams are kept together between projects.

		Teams are composed based on personality types.  The assumption is that a certain composition of personality types works better together.  Traitify will be used to determine a person's personality type.
		Current best composition idea is: Leadership, Work ethic, Social, Creative.  This composition can possibly be changed based on testing data.
		Leader leads.  Social person keeps team communicating and bonding, most likely to organize meetings outside of work and social things, helps resolve disputes and friction.  Creative helps come up with ideas and solutions to problem, strong at deep thinking.  Work ethic keeps team focused on deliverable and on task and motivation.  All teammembers have base line techincal skill and so can all contribute in that regard, and have basic likability and teamwork aptitude.

		The important thing for team performance is member buy in, member work ethic, and team dynamic, not subject knowledge.  The subject knowledge is not as important, and can be learned via internet or outside technical resource.  I.e., teams should not be organized based on subject knowledge, but on team dynamic.  The subject knowledge can then be fed to the team.  This may also have the side effect of creating more creative, disruptive, and effective solutions.  Evolutionary ideas come from newcomers to a subject.
			Story: Plenty of entreprenuers go into a field without knowing it, and learn it and create things better than incumbent experts.

	Parts:
		Our planning:
			Parameters:
			(These can be adjusted based on:
				testing
				project needs
				Or maybe needs to stay the same for psychological reasons)

				Fireteam size:
					4 people
					minimum: 3 people
				Compostion:
					Leader
					Social
					Creative
					Work ethic

					All members should have base level 
						likability
						work ethic
						technical skill


		Initial adoption:
			Break up total engineering team into fireteams
				Have all of engineering team take Traitify assessment
				Fireteams created by our software
					Looks for best way to combine members to best create ideal teams
						Maybe develop next best combinations in case ideal isn't found
							Or group based on whoever has the strongest in those categories
							Figure out how Traitify classifies people
				(our software is done at this point.  We just give the company the plan for how to use the fireteams from here)
				Projects assigned to teams
				Technical resources assigned to teams

		Ongoing implementation:
			When workload exceeds capacity, a new fireteam is created
				Fireteams shouls not exceeed 4 people.  Therfore, an attempt to increase capacity should not be made by adding new individuals to existing fireteams, and increasing size of fireteams.
				Fireteam ideally created all at once, to increase comraderie, similar to military bootcamp
					Story: When I was hired at my last job, I was hired as a group of 4.  We went through onboarding together and had lunch together for the first 3 weeks.  After that, the difference in our technical abilities had us work on different things, but I felt a bond with them the whole year I was there.
				Interviewees are given Traitify assessment
				Best candidates are picked based on technical ability and fireteam composition needs
				If candidates reject offer, replacement candidate chosen (selected by our software) based on composition needs

Specifics of what our software will do
	Interaction with Traitify API
	Having candidates take Traitify test
	Creating groups
		Using entire existing engineering team
			Split groups into fireteams of 4 members each
			Find best way to group them so each team has it's role covered sufficiently
			Create teams of 3 to handle pool that is not a multiple of 4
		Using interviewees
			Same algorithm as above, but only have to create one fireteam.  Can leave all other candidates ungrouped.

How our app will do it:

	Creating Teams:
		Legend:
			L: leader
			S: Social
			
		Example cases:



ToDo
Flesh out what app must do
Flesh out how it will do it (high level)
flesh out algorithm
divide up work
start coding
